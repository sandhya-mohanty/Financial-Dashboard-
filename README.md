### Time Spent
Project setup and routing: 2 hour
Dark mode and layout implementation: 3 hours
Component integration and props typing in TypeScript: 3.5 hours
README and polishing: 30 minutes

Total: ~ 9 hours

## Key Decisions
TypeScript was used for strong type safety and scalability.

React Router v6 was used for routing and nested layout.

Tailwind CSS was chosen for fast, utility-first styling.

All layout components are mobile-first and fully responsive.

isDarkMode is managed at the FinanceDashboard level and passed down as props to avoid complex context/state management for this demo.
